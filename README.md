Smart SNMP Daemon README
========================

http://www.smart-snmpd.org/

Description
-----------

Smart SNMP Daemon is an SNMPv3 compliant daemon, primarily intended to
deliver information for monitoring unix systems.  Monitoring includes
performance values as well as availability checks.

The most important design goal were portability, performance and
ease of use.


License
-------

The Smart SNMP Daemon is distributed under the Apache 2.0 License.
Prerequisites may have different licenses, but according to
http://www.opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical their licenses are
compatible.


Building and Installation
-------------------------

See INSTALL document distributed with this package.


Running
-------

See OPERATION document distributed with this package.


Platform specific notes
-----------------------

Although if not explicitely developed for Unices only, it's not expected
that the Smart SNMP Daemon runs without modifications on Windows.  The
Windows support of libstatgrab needs to be massively improved to reach
this, too.

Similar situation for VMS.
